    <h2>PDE-Constrained Control of Chemical Reactors</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">Modern chemical reactors are governed by complex physics and chemistry: heat transfer, fluid flow, and reaction kinetics interact across the entire reactor volume in highly nonlinear ways. 
      These coupled effects determine conversion, yield, selectivity, energy consumption, and overall stability. 
      Small changes in inlet concentrations, temperatures or catalyst distribution can lead to large variations in output and (financial) yield.</p>

    <p class="intro-text">At the same time, reactors must operate safely. Exothermic reactions can create localized hotspots that damage catalyst beds, shorten reactor lifetime, or trigger runaway reactions. 
      Balancing maximum performance with safe operating conditions is a challenging engineering problem, but one where we can help!

    <p class="intro-text">
      In this project, we optimized a gaseous CO-to-O₂ converter. The physical setup is shown in the figure above. 
      On the left, a fixed mixture of CO and O₂ enters the reactor at a specified inlet temperature T_{\text{in}}. 
      As the gas travels through the catalyzed region, CO is gradually converted into O₂. 
      The objective is to minimize the CO concentration at the outlet. Increasing the inlet temperature accelerates the reaction and improves conversion. 
      However, beyond a critical threshold, the system exhibits thermal runaway: the reaction releases heat, the temperature rises, which accelerates the reaction even further, leading to a sharp temperature spike. 
      The second image shows this temperature spike. The transition is abrupt and displays hysteresis, meaning that once the reactor enters the high-temperature regime, 
      it may not return to the safe branch even if the inlet temperature is reduced, an important operational and safety risk.
