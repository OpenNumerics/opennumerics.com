      <h2>Reliable Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Real Engineering Systems</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">Many engineering workflows require <b>rapid generation of physically realistic solution fields</b>, not just a single high-accuracy simulation. In porous-media transport, this need arises in uncertainty quantification, design exploration, and real-time decision-making 
        — settings where thousands of solution realizations may be required, but full PDE simulations are too slow to be used interactively.
      </p>
  
      <p class="intro-text">In our client's battery project, transport occurs through a heterogeneous porous medium whose microscopic structure is not fully known. Uncertainty is modeled through a spatially varying porosity field $\varepsilon(x)$, which directly affects diffusivity and conductivity.
        The first figure shows a model of this system. 
        For a fixed set of macroscopic operating conditions, <b>different realizations of $\varepsilon(x)$ lead to distinct solution fields</b> for concentration $c(x)$ and electric potential $\varphi(x)$. Accurately capturing this variability is essential for realistic modeling, but solving the PDE with each $\varepsilon(x)$ explicitly is computationally expensive.
      </p>

  <p class="intro-text">   
  Beyond micro-scale uncertainty, the system behavior is strongly influenced by a small number of macroscopic conditioning parameters. In this project, we condition on:
	<ul class="lqc-list">
        <li>Typical spatial scale $l$ of $\varepsilon(x)$</li>
        <li>Voltage $U_0$ applied over the battery</li>
        <li>Boundary current density $I_{\text{right}}$</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p class="intro-text">  
    Together, these parameters define the operating regime of the system and determine how transport, reaction, and electric effects interact. For each choice of $(l, U_0, I_{\text{right}})$, there exists not a single solution, but a distribution of admissible solutions arising from unresolved micro-scale structure.
      </p>
    
    <p class="intro-text">
    To efficiently model this conditional distribution, we turn to score-based generative models (SGMs) — a class of probabilistic models originally developed for high-quality image generation. Rather than predicting one deterministic solution, <b>SGMs learn how to sample full solution fields from the conditional distribution</b>
$$p\big(c(x), \varphi(x) \mid l, U_0, I_{\text{right}}\big),$$
to capture both physical trends and inherent variability.
    </p>
    
    <p class="intro-text">The model is <b>trained on high-fidelity finite-volume simulations</b>, where each training example consists of a solution pair $(c(x), \varphi(x))$ together with its associated conditioning parameters. Spatial structure is handled by convolutional networks, while global parameters and time-like diffusion variables are injected through feature-wise modulation (FiLM). The neural network architecture is displayed here:
      
      </b>During inference, the trained SGM generates new solution realizations via a fast stochastic sampling process.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text"> Once trained, the model produces diverse, physically plausible solution fields <b>orders of magnitude faster than direct PDE simulation</b>. For example, the figure below compares possible solution profiles by the PDE and the SGM, showing clear similarity:

      This project demonstrates how score-based generative models can be used in scientific computing, offering a powerful new approach for fast, conditional solution generation directly meeting our client's needs!
