    <h2>PDE-Constrained Control of Chemical Reactors</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">Modern chemical reactors are governed by complex physics and chemistry: heat transfer, fluid flow, and reaction kinetics interact across the entire reactor volume in highly nonlinear ways. 
      These <strong>coupled effects</strong> determine conversion, yield, selectivity, energy consumption, and overall stability. 
      Small changes in inlet concentrations, temperatures or catalyst distribution can lead to <strong>large variations in output and (financial) yield</strong>.</p>

    <p class="intro-text">At the same time, reactors must operate safely. Exothermic reactions can create localized hotspots that damage catalyst beds, shorten reactor lifetime, or trigger runaway reactions. 
      <strong>Balancing maximum performance with safe operating conditions is a challenging engineering problem, but one where we can help!</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      In this project, we optimized a gaseous CO-to-O₂ converter. The physical setup is shown in the figure above. 
      On the left, a fixed mixture of CO and O₂ enters the reactor at a specified inlet temperature $T_{\text{in}}$. 
      As the gas travels through the catalyzed region, CO is gradually converted into O₂. 
      The objective is to minimize the CO concentration at the outlet. Increasing the inlet temperature accelerates the reaction and improves conversion. 
      However, beyond a critical threshold, the <strong>system exhibits thermal runaway</strong>: the reaction releases heat, the temperature rises, which accelerates the reaction even further, leading to a sharp temperature spike. 
      The second image shows this temperature spike. The transition is abrupt and displays hysteresis, meaning that once the reactor enters the high-temperature regime, 
      it may not return to the safe branch even if the inlet temperature is reduced, an important operational and safety risk.

    </div>

    <p class="intro-text">At Open Numerics, <strong>we built a custom controller that maximizes CO conversion while keeping the reactor safely away from runaway conditions</strong>. 
      Our control input is the catalyst concentration $a(z)$, which determines how rapidly the reaction proceeds along the reactor. 
      The reactor's temperature and species profiles are governed by first-principles PDEs describing transport, heat release, and reaction kinetics. 
      These <strong>physics-based equations serve as constraints in the optimization</strong>, ensuring that every proposed solution respects the true thermochemical behavior of the system.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      We solve the optimization problem
      
      $$\min_{a} J(a) = -\frac{\mathrm{CO}_{\text{out}}}{\mathrm{CO}_{\text{in}}} \;+\; \gamma \int \max(T(z) - T_{\text{in}}, 0)\, dz, $$ 

      balancing high conversion with strict temperature control.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      <strong>Our approach combines high-fidelity physics with cutting-edge optimization techniques.</strong> We use advanced finite-element PDE solvers and adjoint-based gradients to optimize controls efficiently and reliably, even in high-dimensional design spaces. 
      The result is a solution that is optimal, physically interpretable, robust to uncertainty, and fully aligned with engineering safety limits by staying away from the upper branch.

      <strong>For clients, this means safer operation, higher yield, larger profit margins, and the ability to explore design and control strategies digitally - before ever touching the physical reactor.</strong>
