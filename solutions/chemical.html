    <h2>Advanced PDE-Constrained Control of Chemical Reactors</h2>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Modern chemical reactors operate at the intersection of heat transfer, fluid flow, and complex reaction kinetics. 
      These physical and chemical processes are tightly coupled and highly nonlinear, meaning that 
      <strong>small changes in operating conditions</strong> - inlet composition, temperature, or catalyst placement - can propagate through the reactor and lead to 
      <strong>large variations in conversion, yield, energy consumption, and profitability</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      One of our clients operates a gaseous carbon monoxide (CO) to oxygen (O₂) reactor, where catalyst pellets aid in CO conversion. 
      Despite stable inlet conditions, they faced seemingly random temperature spikes that damaged the reactor and incurred a high cost of repair and downtime. 
      The underlying challenge was a familiar one in reactor engineering: 
      <strong>maximize the conversion yield while avoid thermal spikes and damage</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      Exothermic reactions amplify this difficulty. Heat released by the reaction can accumulate locally, degrading catalyst beds, shortening reactor lifetime, 
      or in extreme cases triggering runaway behavior. 
      <strong>Achieving high performance without compromising safety requires deliberate, physics-aware control</strong>, and existing controllers were not up to the task.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      This is precisely where our expertise adds value.
    </p>

      As the gas travels through the catalyzed region, CO is gradually converted into O₂."

    </div>
    
    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <p class="intro-text">
      We <strong>built a custom controller</strong> that maximizes CO conversion while deliberately keeping the reactor away from runaway conditions. From a first-principles
      point of view, we decided to optimize the objective

      $$\min_{a} J(a) = -\frac{\mathrm{CO}_{\text{out}}}{\mathrm{CO}_{\text{in}}} \;+\; \gamma \int \max(T(z) - T_{\text{in}}, 0)\, dz. $$ 

      The first term measures the yield and the second term keeps the reactor away from thermal runaway. By identifying the catalyst concentration $a(z)$ as the primary design variable,
      we gained direct control over both performance and stability. The resulting temperature and species profiles are predicted using first-principles differential equations, 
      which we embed directly into the control design. This <strong>physics-aware, PDE-constrained optimization approach keeps the reactor operating at peak efficiency while respecting strict safety margins.</strong>
      Figure 2 summarizes the physics-aware control loop.

    <h3>The Result</h3>
    <p class="intro-text">
      In summary, our approach <strong>combines high-fidelity physics with cutting-edge optimization techniques</strong>. The result are operating conditions that are optimal, 
      physically interpretable, robust to uncertainty, and fully aligned with engineering safety limits.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      We have been able to eliminate thermal spikes altogether. As a bonus, the <strong>total yield has also increased from 36% to 44%</strong>. For clients, this means safer operation, higher yield, 
      <strong>larger profit margins</strong>, and the ability to explore design and control strategies digitally - before ever touching the reactor.
