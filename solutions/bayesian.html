    <h2>Reliable Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Real Engineering Systems</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">Robust and accurate parameter estimation is essential for building reliable data models, simulations, and digital twins. Whether your goal is identifying material properties, building a physics model, or training a digital twin from measurement data, 
                          you need statistical inference methods that are reliable, stable, and grounded in first principles.</p>

    <p class="intro-text">At Open Numerics we specialize in <strong>robust Bayesian optimization workflows</strong>.</p>                      
    

    <h3>Why Bayesian Methods?</h3>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Bayesian inference provides a principled way to combine:
      <ul class="lqc-list">
        <li>Physics-based models and simulations</li>
        <li>Real-world measurements with uncertainty</li>
        <li>Expert domain knowledge</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      The result is a calibrated parameter estimate that doesn't just fit the data, but captures the uncertainty around it - both in the measurements and 
      expert knowledge! That leads to robust predictions, safer extrapolation, and principled engineering decisions. Bayesian workflows are extremely powerful, 
      but they are hard to get right and require careful numerical engineering. This is where our expertise comes in.
    </p>

    <h3>We build optimization and inference pipelines that are:</h3>
    <p class="intro-text">
      <strong>Robust to noise</strong> by incorporating realistic measurement models and regularization techniques to keep optimization stable.<br>
<br>
      <strong>Efficient for simulation-heavy problems</strong> by combining slow but accurate PDE solves with fast surrogate models to make inference feasible even for complex systems.<br>
<br>
      <strong>Numerically stable </strong> through modern gradient-based optimizers with adaptive step-size control and fast gradient estimation
      strategies tailored to physics-based models.<br>
<br>
      <strong>Scalable as datasets grow</strong> by starting with an initial MAP estimate, we progressively incorporate more data to refine the parameters without
      jeopardizing convergence and learning.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Workflows in Action</h3>
    <p class="intro-text">
      The Young modulus and the Poisson ratio are key mechanical parameters that describe the elastic deformation of materials. A classical experimental setup for estimating these is by clamping the material on the 
      left edge, and applying a constant traction force on the right.

      Using Direct Image Correlation (DIC) measurements these deformations can be observed. These deformations can also be estimated by solving the elastostatic equations
      $$
         - \nabla \cdot \sigma(u) = f(x)
      $$
      for a fixed Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson ratio $\nu$. Bayesian inference solves the inverse problem: find the parameter values $E$ and $\nu$ that describe the DIC measurements best.

      We developed a state-of-the-art Bayesian optimizer that tightly integrates robust MAP estimation with accurate finite element simulations.

      we're excited to help!
