    <h2>Advanced PDE-Constrained Control of Chemical Reactors</h2>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Modern chemical reactors operate at the intersection of heat transfer, fluid flow, and complex reaction kinetics. 
      These physical and chemical processes are tightly coupled and highly nonlinear, meaning that 
      <strong>small changes in operating conditions</strong> - inlet composition, temperature, or catalyst placement - can propagate through the reactor and lead to 
      <strong>large variations in conversion, yield, energy consumption, and profitability</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      One of our clients operates a gaseous carbon monoxide (CO) to oxygen (O₂) reactor, where catalyst pellets aid in CO conversion. 
      Despite stable inlet conditions, they faced seemingly random temperature spikes that damaged the reactor and incurred a high cost of repair and downtime. 
      The underlying challenge was a familiar one in reactor engineering: 
      <strong>maximize the conversion yield while avoid thermal spikes and damage</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      Exothermic reactions amplify this difficulty. Heat released by the reaction can accumulate locally, degrading catalyst beds, shortening reactor lifetime, 
      or in extreme cases triggering runaway behavior. 
      <strong>Achieving high performance without compromising safety requires deliberate, physics-aware control</strong>, and existing controllers were not up to the task.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      This is precisely where our expertise adds value.

    <h3>Our Appraoch</h3>

    <p class="intro-text">
      In this project, <strong>we optimized a gaseous CO-to-O₂ converter</strong>. The physical setup is shown in the figure above. 
      On the left, a fixed mixture of CO and O₂ enters the reactor at a specified inlet temperature $T_{\text{in}}$. 
      As the gas travels through the catalyzed region, CO is gradually converted into O₂. The objective is to minimize the CO concentration at the outlet. Increasing the inlet temperature accelerates the reaction and improves conversion. 
      However, beyond a critical threshold, the <strong>system exhibits thermal runaway</strong>: the reaction releases heat, the temperature rises, which accelerates the reaction even further, leading to a sharp temperature spike. 
      The second image shows this temperature spike. The transition is abrupt and displays hysteresis, meaning that once the reactor enters the high-temperature regime, 
      it may not return to the safe branch even if the inlet temperature is reduced, an important operational and safety risk.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p class="intro-text">At Open Numerics, <strong>we built a custom controller that maximizes CO conversion while keeping the reactor safely away from runaway conditions</strong>. 
      Our control input is the catalyst concentration $a(z)$, which determines how rapidly the reaction proceeds along the reactor. 
      The reactor's temperature and species profiles are governed by first-principles PDEs describing transport, heat release, and reaction kinetics. 
      These <strong>physics-based equations serve as constraints in the optimization</strong>, ensuring that every proposed solution respects the true thermochemical behavior of the system.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      We solve the optimization problem
      
      $$\min_{a} J(a) = -\frac{\mathrm{CO}_{\text{out}}}{\mathrm{CO}_{\text{in}}} \;+\; \gamma \int \max(T(z) - T_{\text{in}}, 0)\, dz, $$ 

      balancing high conversion with strict temperature control.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      <strong>Our approach combines high-fidelity physics with cutting-edge optimization techniques.</strong> We use advanced finite-element PDE solvers and adjoint-based gradients to optimize controls efficiently and reliably, even in high-dimensional design spaces. 
      The result is a solution that is optimal, physically interpretable, robust to uncertainty, and fully aligned with engineering safety limits by staying away from the upper branch.

      <strong>For clients, this means safer operation, higher yield, larger profit margins, and the ability to explore design and control strategies digitally - before ever touching the physical reactor.</strong>
