                <p><strong>Turning Scientific Data into Predictive Power.</strong></p>
                <p>From physical measurements to simulation outputs, scientific data is everywhere but traditional models often struggle. They may oversimplify complex dynamics or demand excessive compute. We address this by building custom machine learning tools tailored to your scientific workflows.</p>
                <p>Our approach draws on scientific machine learning (SciML), where first-principles physics meets data-driven modeling. Whether you're accelerating a numerical solver, constructing a digital twin, or learning unknown dynamics from experiments, we develop models that are accurate, efficient, and physically grounded.</p>
                <p>Use cases include building foundation models, design optimization, and uncertainty quantification: all powered by modern ML for science.</p>
