      <h2>Fast Exploration of Realistic Designs using Score-based Generative Models</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">Many engineering workflows require <b>rapid generation of physically realistic designs</b>, not just a single high-accuracy simulation. 
        An example is porous-media transport. Here, there is a need for uncertainty quantification, design exploration, and real-time decision-making 
        — settings where thousands of quick design realizations may be required, but full computational model is too slow to be used interactively.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Our Client's Need</h3>
      <p class="intro-text">In our client's project, ion transport occurs through a battery (a heterogeneous porous medium) whose microscopic structure is not fully unraveled. 
        This micro-scale uncertainty is modeled through a spatially varying porosity field $\varepsilon(x)$, which directly affects diffusivity, conductivity and the operating conditions of the battery.
        For a fixed set of macroscopic operating conditions, <b>different realizations of $\varepsilon(x)$ lead to distinct solution fields</b> for the ion concentration $c(x)$ 
        and the electric potential $\varphi(x)$. Accurately capturing this variability is essential for realistic modeling, but solving the first-principles physics is generally too computationally.
      </p>

      <p class="intro-text">
        The figure below shows the porosity field, ion concentration and potential and how they link to the macroscopic operating conditions.

      </p>

      <p class="intro-text">   
        Combined, uncertainty is strongly influenced three main macroscopic conditioning parameters:
        <ul class="lqc-list">
          <li>Typical spatial scale $l$ of $\varepsilon(x)$</li>
          <li>Voltage $U_0$ applied over the battery</li>
          <li>Boundary current density $I_{\text{right}}$</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">  
        For each choice of $(l, U_0, I_{\text{right}})$, there exists not a single solution, but a distribution of admissible solutions 
        $(c(x), \varphi(x))$ arising from unresolved micro-scale structure.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Our Solution: Generative AI for real Industrial Applications</h3>
      <p class="intro-text">
        To efficiently model this conditional distribution, we turn to score-based generative models (SGMs) — a class of probabilistic models originally developed for high-quality image generation. 
        State-of-the-art technologies such as <a href="https://stablediffusionweb.com/">Stable Diffusion</a> are built on SGMs.
        Rather than predicting one deterministic solution, <b>SGMs learn how to sample full solution fields from the conditional distribution</b>
          $$p\big(c(x), \varphi(x) \mid l, U_0, I_{\text{right}}\big),$$
        to capture both physical trends and inherent variability. This is one of the first times that GenAI methods were used to solve real scientific and industrial needs - and we are 
        extremely proud of this accomplishment.
      </p>
    
      <p class="intro-text">Some more details: the model is <b>trained on high-fidelity finite-volume simulations</b> of the underlying physics, 
        where each training example consists of a solution pair $(c(x), \varphi(x))$ together with its associated conditioning parameters. 
        Spatial structure is handled by convolutional networks, while global parameters and time-like diffusion variables are injected through feature-wise modulation (FiLM). 
        The neural network architecture is displayed below.

      </p>

      <p class="intro-text"> Once trained, the model produces diverse, physically plausible designs <b>orders of magnitude faster than direct physics simulations</b>. 
        Even more, our approach captures the uncertainty very well. The final figure shows the mean and 95% confidence interval of 500 realizations of the SGM

        This project demonstrates how <b>generative AI can be used in scientific computing, offering a powerful new approach for fast design exploration!</b>
